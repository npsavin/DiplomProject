symptom : "Disclosure details CVE-2014-0208: stored cross site scripting (XSS) in search auto-completion The search auto-completion was vulnerable to a stored cross site scripting (XSS) attack via completion of (global/host) parameters in search keys ; CVE-2014-0090: session fixation, new session IDs are not generated on login Upon successful login, a new session ID was not generated for the user, so an attacker who had set the session ID in the request from the user\'s browser would be able to exploit the escalated session with the user\'s privileges ; CVE-2013-4386: SQL injection in host/host group parameter overrides Host and host group parameter overrides (lookup_values) allowed SQL injection from the host FQDN or host group label ; CVE-2013-4182: hosts API privilege escalation The /api/hosts API was found to provide access to all hosts without checking whether the current user has privileges to view a particular host ; CVE-2013-0174: exposed hashed root passwords can be retrieved by unauthenticated remote users The external node classifier (ENC) API in Foreman was accessible to any remote host and the output would contain the hashed root psasword (used for unattended installation) ; CVE-2013-0171: import allows unauthenticated YAML uploads/parsing leading to arbitrary code execution Fact and report import APIs in Foreman were accessible to any remote host and accepted YAML input, allowing arbitrary objects to be created on the Foreman server via YAML ; Files managed by the smart proxy could be modified by local users on the same host",

countermeasures : "We will endeavour to resolve high severity issues in the current stable release and lower severity issues in the next major release ; Announcements of security issues will be made on  foreman-announce  when a release containing a fix is available to end users and credit will be given to the researcher if desired ; CVE-2013-2113: admin user creation, privilege escalation Non-admin user with permissions to create or edit other users were able to change the admin flag, or assign roles that they themselves do not have, enabling a privilege escalation ; CVE-2013-0173: insecure fixed salt \"foreman\" for passwords The salt used to hash root passwords (used for unattended installation) was fixed to the string \"foreman\" instead of being randomized ; Authentication and authorization features were added to the import APIs to prevent this"
