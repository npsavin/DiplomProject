{result:[{name : "CVE-2012-0036",
symptom : "VULNERABILITY   curl is vulnerable to a data injection attack for certain protocols through control characters embedded or percent-encoded in URLs ;   In the specific process when libcurl extracts the file path part from a given URL, it didn\'t always verify the data or escape control characters properly before it passed the file path on to the protocol-specific code that then would use it for its protocol business ;   This passing through of control characters could be exploited by someone who would be able to pass in a handicrafted URL to libcurl",
threat : "VULNERABILITY   curl is vulnerable to a data injection attack for certain protocols through control characters embedded or percent-encoded in URLs ;   A malicious user might pass in %0d%0a to get treated as CR LF by libcurl, and by using this fact a user can trick for example a POP3 client to delete a message instead of getting it or trick an SMTP server to send an unintended message",
consequences : "  There is no known exploit for this problem ; AFFECTED VERSIONS   Affected versions: curl 7.20.0 to and including 7.23.1 Not affected versions: curl < 7.20.0 and >= 7.24.0   Also note that libcurl is used by many applications, and not always advertised as such",
countermeasures : "Lots of libcurl using applications let users enter URLs in one form or another and not all of these check the input carefully to prevent malicious ones ; RECOMMENDATIONS   We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:   A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.24.0   B - Apply this patch and rebuild libcurl   http://curl.haxx.se/curl-url-sanitize.patch   C - Rebuild curl with support for vulnerable protocols IMAP, POP3 and SMTP disabled ;   We discussed solutions and a first patch was written on the same day"
