symptom : "  Exploiting this flaw, a malicious server could participate in a MITM attack or just easier fool users that it is a legitimate site for whatever purpose, when it actually isn\'t ;   A good CA should refuse to issue a certificate with the CN as indicated, however there only need be one CA to issue one in error for this issue to result in the user getting no warning at all and being vulnerable to MITM ; THE SOLUTION   libcurl 7.36.0 has an improved host name verification function that rejects wild card matching against IP addresses",
