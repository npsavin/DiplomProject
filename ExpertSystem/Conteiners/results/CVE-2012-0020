This is a remote code execution vulnerability.  What causes the vulnerability?   
The vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Visio Viewer handles memory when parsing specially crafted Visio files. What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?   
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?   
This vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Visio file with an affected version of Microsoft Visio Viewer. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Visio file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a website that contains a specially crafted Visio file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit a website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince the user to open a specially crafted Visio file. What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?   
Systems where Microsoft Visio Viewer is used, including workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

Office Administrative Installation Point If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the  Update Compatibility Evaluator  components included with  Application Compatibility Toolkit . The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.
