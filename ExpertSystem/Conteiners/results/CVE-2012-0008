The vulnerability could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker places a specially crafted add-in in the path used by Visual Studio and convinces a user with higher privileges to start Visual Studio. An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users. This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2010. For more information, see the subsection,  Affected and Non-Affected Software , in this section. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which Visual Studio restricts where add-ins are loaded. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section,  Vulnerability Information . Recommendation.  The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see  Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871 . For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the  Microsoft Update  service. See also the section,  Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance , later in this bulletin.

Elevation of Privilege Important Visual Studio Add-In Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0008 An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Visual Studio due to the insecure loading of add-ins from within Visual Studio. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with elevated privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see  CVE-2012-0008 . Mitigating Factors for Visual Studio Add-In Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0008 Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation: Workarounds for Visual Studio Add-In Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0008 Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability. FAQ for Visual Studio Add-In Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0008 What is the scope of the vulnerability?   
This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. What causes the vulnerability?   
This vulnerability is caused by Visual Studio loading add-ins from insecure file locations. What is  a Visual Studio  a dd- i n ?   
Visual Studio add-ins implement an extensibility interface within Visual Studio for customizing and automating the interactive development environment (IDE). Developers choose to automate the Visual Studio IDE to increase their productivity. As developers create more and more applications, they may find themselves spending more time doing redundant project setup and configuration. Add-ins help developers cut out redundancy and allow them to focus on core development tasks. Developers can take this mundane set of steps out of the process by using a combination of add-ins, macros, and templates. For more information about Visual Studio add-ins, see the MSDN article,  Creating Visual Studio Add-Ins . What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?   
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with elevated privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. How could an attacker exploit the  vulnerability?   
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then place a specially crafted add-in in the path used by Visual Studio. When Visual Studio is started by an administrator, the specially crafted add-in would be loaded with the same privileges as the administrator. What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?   
Systems where Microsoft Visual Studio is used for development, including workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this. What does the update do?   
The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting the manner in which Visual Studio restricts where add-ins are loaded. When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?   
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?   
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the  Update Compatibility Evaluator  components included with  Application Compatibility Toolkit . The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.
