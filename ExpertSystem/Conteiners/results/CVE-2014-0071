Details Updated openstack-packstack packages that fix one security issue and 
multiple bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack 
Platform 4.0. 

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having 
Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) 
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the 
CVE link in the References section. 
PackStack is a command-line utility that uses Puppet modules to support 
rapid deployment of OpenStack on existing servers over an SSH connection. 
PackStack is suitable for deploying both single node proof-of-concept 
installations and more complex multi-node installations. 

It was found that PackStack did not correctly install the rules defined in 
the default security groups when deployed on OpenStack Networking 
(neutron), allowing network connections to be made to systems that should 
not have been accessible. (CVE-2014-0071) 

This update also fixes the following bugs: 

* Previously, swift's object versioning was disabled by default. With this 
update, this feature is now enabled in the default configuration file 
('allow_versions "true"' in /etc/swift/container-server.conf). (BZ#967308) 

* Previously, it was not possible to run neutron with Open vSwitch using 
Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN). This update adds support for VXLAN in 
neutron. (BZ#1021778) 

* PackStack failed to complete the deployment of OpenStack due to the 
MongoDB service (mongod) being terminated by systemd. This was because 
mongod, when first started, exceeded the timeout value set by systemd. 
With this update, mongod uses small files when it is initially started, and 
no longer exceeds systemd's timeout value. (BZ#1036207) 

* Previously, services for OpenStack Compute and other OpenStack components 
ran in debug mode by default. With this update, the CONFIG_DEBUG_MODE 
configuration parameter has been added. When this parameter is set to 'y', 
all OpenStack services will run in debug mode. By default, debug mode is 
disabled. (BZ#1048041) 

Note: Currently, PackStack does not support deployment of the ML2 Neutron 
plug-in. The ML2 plug-in can be used in manual configurations, or by 
deploying initially with the Open vSwitch plug-in using PackStack and 
converting the installation to use ML2. This method is described at 
http://openstack.redhat.com/Modular_Layer_2_%28ML2%29_Plugin . The progress 
on fixing this bug can be followed in Red Hat Bugzilla bug 1017144. 

All openstack-packstack users are advised to upgrade to these updated 
packages, which correct these issues. 

Solution Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata 
relevant to your system have been applied. 

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
