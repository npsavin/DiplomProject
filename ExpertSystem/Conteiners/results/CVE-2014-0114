Description Arun Babu Neelicattu  2014-04-28 07:01:53 EDT  It was found that Apache Struts 1 allows the setting of Class Loader attributes via the 'class' attribute of the ActionForm obbject, which is directly mapped to it's getClass() method, using request parameters. A remote attacker could use this flaw to manupulate the loaded Class Loader. This in some cases may lead arbitrary remote code executions. Comment 10 Arun Babu Neelicattu  2014-04-29 07:14:56 EDT   Created struts tracking bugs for this issue: Affects: fedora-all [ bug 1092452 ] Comment 20 David Jorm  2014-05-02 03:06:29 EDT  Statement: This flaw allows attackers to manipulate ClassLoader properties on a vulnerable server. The impact of this depends on which ClassLoader properties are exposed. Exploits that lead to remote code execution have been published. These exploits rely on ClassLoader properties that are exposed on Tomcat 8, which is not included in any supported Red Hat products. However, some Red Hat products that ship Struts 1 do expose ClassLoader properties that could potentially be exploited.
