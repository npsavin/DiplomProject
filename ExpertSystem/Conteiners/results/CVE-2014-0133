 Description:

 Fixed security issues: 
 * CVE-2014-0133: nginx:heap-based buffer overflow in SPDY 
 implementation 

 New upstream release 1.4.7 (bnc#869076) (CVE-2014-0133) 
 *) Security: a heap memory buffer overflow might occur 
 in a worker process while handling a specially crafted 
 request by ngx_http_spdy_module, potentially resulting in 
 arbitrary code execution (CVE-2014-0133). Thanks to Lucas 
 Molas, researcher at Programa STIC, FundaciÃ³n Dr. Manuel 
 Sadosky, Buenos Aires, Argentina. 
 *) Bugfix: in the "fastcgi_next_upstream" directive. 
 Thanks to Lucas Molas. 
 *) Bugfix: the "client_max_body_size" directive might 
 not work when reading a request body using chunked transfer 
 encoding; the bug had appeared in 1.3.9. Thanks to Lucas 
 Molas. 
 *) Bugfix: a segmentation fault might occur in a worker 
 process when proxying WebSocket connections. 
 *) Bugfix: the $ssl_session_id variable contained full 
 session serialized instead of just a session id. Thanks to 
 Ivan RistiÄ. 
 *) Bugfix: client connections might be immediately 
 closed if deferred accept was used; the bug had appeared in 
 1.3.15. 
 *) Bugfix: alerts "zero size buf in output" might 
 appear in logs while proxying; the bug had appeared in 
 1.3.9. 
 *) Bugfix: a segmentation fault might occur in a worker 
 process if the ngx_http_spdy_module was used. 
 *) Bugfix: proxied WebSocket connections might hang 
 right after handshake if the select, poll, or /dev/poll 
 methods were used. 
 *) Bugfix: a timeout might occur while reading client 
 request body in an SSL connection using chunked transfer 
 encoding. 
 *) Bugfix: memory leak in nginx/Windows.
