The vulnerability could allow denial of service if a remote unauthenticated attacker sends a specially crafted DNS query to the target DNS server. This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Windows Server 2003, 32-bit and x64-based editions of Windows Server 2008, and x64-based editions of Windows Server 2008 R2. For more information, see the subsection,  Affected and Non-Affected Software , in this section. The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that the DNS server handles objects in memory. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section,  Vulnerability Information . Recommendation.  The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see  Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871 . For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the  Microsoft Update  service. See also the section,  Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance , later in this bulletin.

Refer to the reference tables in the  Security Update Deployment  section for the location of the file information details. I am running one of the platforms that are listed in the Affected Software table. Why am I not being offered the update ?   
The update can only be installed if DNS is enabled on the operating systems listed in the Affected Software table. By default, DNS is not enabled on these operating systems, so the update will not be offered unless DNS has been enabled. I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?   
The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, visit the  Microsoft Support Lifecycle  website. It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see  Select a Product for Lifecycle Information . For more information about service packs for these software releases, see  Service Pack Lifecycle Support Policy . Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the  Microsoft Worldwide Information  website, select the country in the Contact Information list, and then click  Go  to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the  Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ .

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see  CVE-2012-0006 . Mitigating Factors for DNS Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0006 Microsoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability. Workarounds for DNS Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0006 Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality: FAQ for DNS Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0006 What is the scope of the vulnerability?   
This is a denial of service vulnerability. What causes the vulnerability?   
The vulnerability is caused when the DNS server improperly handles objects in memory while looking up a resource record. What is  a DNS resource record ?   
A DNS resource record (RR) identifies a particular resource within a domain. For more information, see the TechNet article,  How DNS Works . What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?   
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the target system to stop responding and automatically restart. How could an attacker exploit the  vulnerability?   
A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted DNS query to the target DNS server. What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?   
Servers running the DNS role are primarily at risk. Servers that do not have this role enabled are not at risk. What does the update do?   
The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that the DNS server handles objects in memory. When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?   
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?   
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the  Update Compatibility Evaluator  components included with  Application Compatibility Toolkit . The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

Deployment Information Installing the Update When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix. If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see  Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994 . For more information about the installer, see  Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475 . For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as  hotfix , see  Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684 . This security update supports the following setup switches. Supported Security Update Installation Switches Switch Description /help Displays the command-line options. Setup Modes /passive Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. /quiet Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. Restart Options /norestart Does not restart when installation has completed. / forcerestart Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. / warnrestart [:x] Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in  x  seconds.
