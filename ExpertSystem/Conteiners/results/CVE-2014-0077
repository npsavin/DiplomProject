Description Petr Matousek  2014-02-12 11:00:54 EST  A flaw was found in the way handle_rx() function handled big packets when mergeable buffers were disabled. A privileged user in the guest could use this flaw to crash the host, or, potentially, escalate their privileges to the ones of the hosting qemu process by corrupting qemu memory.
