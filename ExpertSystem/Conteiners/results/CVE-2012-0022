[SECURITY] CVE-2012-0022 Apache Tomcat Denial of Service From:  Mark Thomas ( markt apache.org ) 
Date:  Tue Jan 17 2012 - 05:34:58 CST   CVE-2012-0022 Apache Tomcat Denial of Service  
Severity: Important  
Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation  
Versions Affected:  
 - Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.22  
 - Tomcat 6.0.0 to 6.0.33  
 - Tomcat 5.5.0 to 5.5.34  
 - Earlier, unsupported versions may also be affected  
Description:  
 Analysis of the recent hash collision vulnerability identified unrelated  
 inefficiencies with Apache Tomcat's handling of large numbers of  
 parameters and parameter values. These inefficiencies could allow an  
 attacker, via a specially crafted request, to cause large amounts of CPU  
 to be used which in turn could create a denial of service.  
 The issue was addressed by modifying the Tomcat parameter handling code  
 to efficiently process large numbers of parameters and parameter values.  
Mitigation:  
 Users of affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations:  
 - Tomcat 7.0.x users should upgrade to 7.0.23 or later  
 - Tomcat 6.0.x users should upgrade to 6.0.35 or later  
 - Tomcat 5.5.x users should upgrade to 5.5.35 or later  
Credit:  
 The inefficiencies in handling large numbers of parameters were  
 identified by the Apache Tomcat security team.
