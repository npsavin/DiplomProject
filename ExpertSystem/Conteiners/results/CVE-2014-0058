JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2 EL6 CVEs ( cve.mitre.org ): CVE-2014-0058 

Details Updated Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2.1 packages that 
fix one security issue are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 
and 6. 

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Low 
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, 
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in 
the References section. 
Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java 
applications based on JBoss Application Server 7. 

It was found that the security audit functionality, as provided by Red Hat 
JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6, logged request parameters in plain 
text. This may have caused passwords to be included in the audit log files 
when using BASIC or FORM-based authentication. A local attacker with access 
to audit log files could possibly use this flaw to obtain application or 
server authentication credentials. (CVE-2014-0058) 

The provided patch to fix CVE-2014-0058 also allows greater control over 
which of the following components of web requests are captured in audit 
logs: 

 - parameters 
 - cookies 
 - headers 
 - attributes 

It is also possible to selectively mask some elements of headers, 
parameters, cookies, and attributes using masks. This capability is 
provided by two system properties, which are introduced by this patch: 

1) org.jboss.security.web.audit 

Description: 
This property controls the granularity of the security auditing of web 
requests. 

Possible values: 
off = Disables auditing of web requests 
headers = Audits only the headers of web requests 
cookies = Audits only the cookies of web requests 
parameters = Audits only the parameters of web requests 
attributes = Audits only the attributes of web requests 
headers,cookies,parameters = Audits the headers, cookies, and parameters of 
web requests 
headers,cookies = Audits the headers and cookies of web requests 

Default Value: 
headers, parameters 

Examples: 
Setting "org.jboss.security.web.audit=off" disables security auditing of 
web requests entirely. 
Setting "org.jboss.security.web.audit=headers" enables security auditing of 
only headers in web requests. 

2) org.jboss.security.web.audit.mask 

Description: 
This property can be used to specify a list of strings to be matched 
against headers, parameters, cookies, and attributes of web requests. 
Any element matching the specified masks will be excluded from security 
audit logging. 

Possible values: 
Any comma separated string indicating keys of headers, parameters, cookies, 
and attributes. 

Default Value: 
j_password, authorization 

Note that currently the matching of the masks is fuzzy rather than strict. 
For example, a mask of "authorization" will mask both the header called 
authorization and the parameter called "custom_authorization". A future 
release may introduce strict masks. 

Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss 
Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications. 

All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2.1 on Red Hat 
Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages. 
The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect. 

Solution Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata 
relevant to your system have been applied. Also, back up any customized Red 
Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 configuration files. On update, 
the configuration files that have been locally modified will not be 
updated. The updated version of such files will be stored as the rpmnew 
files. Make sure to locate any such files after the update and merge any 
changes manually. 

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the 
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
