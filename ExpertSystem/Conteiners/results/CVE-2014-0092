The GnuTLS Transport Layer Security Library Advisories Tag Other identifiers Severity Information GNUTLS-SA-2014-2  CVE-2014-0092 Certificate verification issue A vulnerability was discovered that affects the certificate verification functions of all gnutls versions. A specially crafted certificate could bypass certificate validation checks. The vulnerability was discovered during an audit of GnuTLS for Red Hat.  Who is affected by this attack? How are past sessions affected? How to mitigate the attack? GNUTLS-SA-2014-1  CVE-2014-1959 Certificate verification issue Suman Jana reported a vulnerability that affects the certificate verification functions of gnutls 2.11.5 and later versions. A version 1 intermediate certificate will be considered as a CA certificate by default (something that deviates from the documented behavior).  Who is affected by this attack? How to mitigate the attack? GNUTLS-SA-2013-3  CVE-2013-4466 Denial of service This vulnerability affects the DANE library of gnutls 3.1.x and gnutls 3.2.x. A server that returns more 4 DANE entries could corrupt the memory of a requesting client. 
Recommendation:  Upgrade to the latest gnutls version (3.1.16 or 3.2.6) GNUTLS-SA-2013-2  CVE-2013-2116 Denial of service This vulnerability affects gnutls 2.12.23 and its TLS record decoding. 
Recommendation:  Apply  the patch  or upgrade to gnutls 3.x. GNUTLS-SA-2013-1  TLS CBC padding timing attack 
 CVE-2013-1619 Possible plaintext recovery  Nadhem Alfardan and Kenny Paterson devised an attack that recovers some bits of the plaintext of a GnuTLS session that utilizes that CBC ciphersuites, by using timing information.   In order for the attack to work the client must operate as follows. It connects to a server, it sends some (encrypted) data that will be intercepted by the attacker, who will terminate the client's connection abnormally (i.e. the client will receive a premature termination error). The client should repeat that, multiple times.  Who is affected by this attack? How to mitigate the attack? Write-up by Nikos 
GNUTLS-SA-2012-4  "CRIME" attack 
 CVE-2012-4929 Possible plaintext recovery There is an attack on TLS called "CRIME" which takes advantage of compression and may recover plaintext under certain circumstances. Who is affected by this attack? How to mitigate the attack?  Note that using compression provides  information to an attacker  on the plaintext.

GNUTLS-SA-2012-3  CVE-2012-1569 Denial of service This vulnerability is in the libtasn1 library and affects the DER length decoding which is fixed in  2.12 release . 
 Write-up by Mu Dynamics 
Recommendation:  Upgrade to libtasn1 2.12. GNUTLS-SA-2012-2  CVE-2012-1573 Possible buffer overflow/Denial of service TLS record handling vulnerability fixed in  GnuTLS 3.0.15 . 
 Write-up by Mu Dynamics 
Recommendation:  Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.0.17 or 2.12.18. GNUTLS-SA-2012-1  CVE-2012-0390 Timing attack (DTLS)  Announcement of GnuTLS 3.0.11 
 The paper describing the attack 
 This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform partial plaintext recovery using a timing attack in CBC-mode encryption. The attack is applicable to Datagram TLS (DTLS).  
Recommendation:  Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.0.11.  GNUTLS-SA-2011-2  CVE-2011-4128 Possible buffer overflow/Denial of service  Mailing list discussion 
 Note that this vulnerability is triggered by TLS clients that utilize the session resumption functions in a particular way. Clients that perform session resumption using the same steps as in  the example code of GnuTLS documentation  are not vulnerable. A preliminary analysis found no vulnerable clients.  Recommendation:  Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.0.7 or 2.12.14.  GNUTLS-SA-2011-1  Rizzo attack on TLS Plaintext recovery  Mailing list discussion 
Recommendation:  Make use of TLS 1.1 or TLS 1.2 protocols that are not vulnerable to the attack. TLS 1.1 is enabled by default in GnuTLS since version 2.0.0 (released in 2007). If this is not possible, disable CBC ciphers. GNUTLS-SA-2010-1  CVE-2010-0731 Remote Denial of Service  RedHat bugzilla report 
 Mailing list discussion This vulnerability is on a deprecated since 2006 version of GnuTLS. We keep the information here because this version was included in some distributions.  Recommendation:  Upgrade to the latest stable branch. GNUTLS-SA-2009-5 CERT VU#120541 
 CVE-2009-3555 Plaintext injection attack  Mailing list discussion Recommendation:  Disable support for TLS renegotiation in application servers, or better upgrade to GnuTLS 2.10.x. GNUTLS-SA-2009-4  CVE-2009-2730 False positive in certificate hostname validation  Announcement of v2.8.3 that solves the problem.
