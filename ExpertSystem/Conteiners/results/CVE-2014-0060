Details Updated cfme packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs, and 
add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat CloudForms 3.0. 

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having 
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base 
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each 
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section. 
Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine delivers the insight, control, and 
automation needed to address the challenges of managing virtual 
environments. 

A flaw was found in the way Ruby on Rails' actionpack rubygem performed 
JSON parameter parsing. An application using a third party library, which 
uses the Rack::Request interface, or custom Rack middleware could bypass 
the protection implemented to fix the CVE-2013-0155 vulnerability, causing 
the application to receive unsafe parameters and become vulnerable to 
CVE-2013-0155. (CVE-2013-6417) 

An input sanitization flaw was found in the saved_report_delete action in 
the ReportController. An authenticated Management Engine user could use 
this flaw to perform an SQL injection attack on the Management Engine back 
end database. (CVE-2014-0137) 

It was found that Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine did not properly 
check user role permissions for actions associated with catalogs. 
An authenticated Management Engine user could use this flaw to delete 
arbitrary catalogs regardless of the granted permissions. (CVE-2014-0078) 

Multiple stack-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the date/time 
implementation of PostgreSQL. An authenticated database user could provide 
a specially crafted date/time value that, when processed, could cause 
PostgreSQL to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the 
permissions of the user running PostgreSQL. (CVE-2014-0063) 

Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows, 
were found in various type input functions in PostgreSQL. An authenticated 
database user could possibly use these flaws to crash PostgreSQL or, 
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user 
running PostgreSQL. (CVE-2014-0064, CVE-2014-2669) 

Multiple potential buffer overflow flaws were found in PostgreSQL. 
An authenticated database user could possibly use these flaws to crash 
PostgreSQL or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of 
the user running PostgreSQL. (CVE-2014-0065) 

It was found that granting an SQL role to a database user in a PostgreSQL 
database without specifying the "ADMIN" option allowed the grantee to 
remove other users from their granted role. An authenticated database user 
could use this flaw to remove a user from an SQL role which they were 
granted access to. (CVE-2014-0060) 

A flaw was found in the validator functions provided by PostgreSQL's 
procedural languages. An authenticated database user could possibly use 
this flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2014-0061) 

A race condition was found in the way PostgreSQL's CREATE INDEX command 
performed multiple independent lookups of a table that had to be indexed. 
An authenticated database user could possibly use this flaw to escalate 
their privileges. (CVE-2014-0062) 

It was found that the chkpass extension of PostgreSQL did not check the 
return value of the crypt() function. An authenticated database user could 
possibly use this flaw to crash PostgreSQL via a null pointer dereference. 
(CVE-2014-0066) 

Red Hat would like to thank the Ruby on Rails project for reporting 
CVE-2013-6417; upstream acknowledges Sudhir Rao as the original reporter 
of this issue. 

Red Hat would also like to thank the PostgreSQL project for reporting 
CVE-2014-0060, CVE-2014-0061, CVE-2014-0062, CVE-2014-0063, CVE-2014-0064, 
CVE-2014-0065, CVE-2014-0066, and CVE-2014-2669; upstream acknowledges Noah 
Misch, Heikki Linnakangas, Peter Eisentraut, Jozef Mlich, Andres Freund, 
Robert Haas, Honza Horak, and Bruce Momjian as the original reporters of 
these issues. 

The CVE-2014-0137 and CVE-2014-0078 issues were discovered by Jan Rusnacko 
of the Red Hat Product Security Team.
