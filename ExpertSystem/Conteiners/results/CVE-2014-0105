Skip to navigation Search  Search  Important: python-keystoneclient security update Advisory: RHSA-2014:0382-2 Type: Security Advisory Severity: Important Issued on: 2014-04-09 Last updated on: 2014-04-09 Affected Products: Red Hat OpenStack 4.0 CVEs ( cve.mitre.org ): CVE-2014-0105 

Details Updated python-keystoneclient packages that fix one security issue are now 
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0. 

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having 
Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) 
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the 
CVE link in the References section. 
Python-keystoneclient is a client library and a command line utility for 
interacting with the OpenStack Identity API. The OpenStack Identity 
auth_token middleware component handles the authentication of tokens 
with keystone. 

When using the auth_token middleware with the memcached token cache 
enabled, a token for a different identity could be returned. An 
authenticated user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges by 
making repeated requests that could eventually allow the user to acquire 
the administrator's identity. Note that only OpenStack Identity setups 
using auth_token with memcached were affected. (CVE-2014-0105) 

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue. 
Upstream acknowledges Kieran Spear from the University of Melbourne as the 
original reporter. 

The python-keystoneclient package has been upgraded to version 0.7.1. 
Additionally, the python-six package has been upgraded to version 1.5.2, 
required by the updated python-keystoneclient package. 

All python-keystoneclient users are advised to upgrade to these updated 
packages, which correct this issue. After installing this update, all 
OpenStack services using auth_token must be restarted for this update to 
take effect. 

Solution Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata 
relevant to your system have been applied.
