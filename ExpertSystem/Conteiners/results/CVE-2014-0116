Solution In Struts 2.3.16.3 the same exclude patterns were used in CookieInterceptor which are available in ParametersInterceptor. If you don't use CookieInterceptor you are safe. Backward compatibility No backward compatibility problems are expected. Workaround If you cannot upgrade to version 2.3.16.3 immediately -  which is strongly advised -  don't use wildcard mapping to accept cookie names or implement your own version of CookieInterceptor based on code provided in Struts 2.3.16.3.
