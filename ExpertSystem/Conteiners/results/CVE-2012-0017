These vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege or information disclosure if a user clicked a specially crafted URL.  This security update is rated Important for Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2010 and Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010. For more information, see the subsection,  Affected and Non-Affected Software , in this section. The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting the way that Microsoft SharePoint validates and sanitizes user input. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section,  Vulnerability Information . Recommendation.  Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the  Microsoft Update  service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating in supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, see  Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871 . For information about automatic updating in supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, see  Understanding Windows automatic updating . For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the  Microsoft Update  service. See also the section,  Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance , later in this bulletin.

Elevation of Privilege Important XSS in inplview.aspx Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0017 A cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in Microsoft SharePoint 2010 that could result in information disclosure or elevation of privilege if a user clicks a specially crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript elements. Due to the vulnerability, when the malicious JavaScript is echoed back to the user's browser, the resulting page could allow an attacker to issue SharePoint commands in the context of the authenticated user on the targeted SharePoint site. To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see  CVE-2012-0017 . Mitigating Factors for XSS in inplview.aspx Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0017 Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation: Workarounds for XSS in inplview.aspx Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0017 Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality: FAQ for XSS in inplview.aspx Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0017 What is the scope of the vulnerability?   
This is a cross-site scripting vulnerability that could result in elevation of privilege or information disclosure. What causes the vulnerability?   
The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft SharePoint does not properly handle malicious JavaScript elements contained within a specially crafted URL, allowing the script to be displayed back to the user's browser. What is cross-site scripting?   
Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a class of security vulnerability that can enable an attacker to inject script code into a user's session with a website. The vulnerability can affect web servers that dynamically generate HTML pages. If these servers embed browser input in the dynamic pages that they send back to the browser, these servers can be manipulated to include maliciously supplied content in the dynamic pages. This can allow malicious script to be executed. Web browsers may perpetuate this problem through their assumptions of trusted sites and their use of cookies to maintain persistent state with the websites that they frequent. An XSS attack does not modify website content. Instead, it inserts new, malicious script that can execute at the browser in the context that is associated with a trusted server. What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?   
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read content that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the victim, such as change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in the browser of the victim. How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?   
For this vulnerability to be exploited, a user must click a specially crafted URL that takes the user to a targeted SharePoint site that then displays the script back to the user's browser. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending an email message containing the specially crafted URL to the user of the targeted SharePoint site and by convincing the user to click on the specially crafted URL. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a website that contains a specially crafted URL to the targeted SharePoint site that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's website, and then convince them to click on the specially crafted URL. What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?   
Systems where users connect to a SharePoint server, such as workstations or terminal servers, are primarily at risk. What does the update do?   
The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that Microsoft SharePoint validates and sanitizes user input. When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?   
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?   
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

Note for Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2010  The detection table described above is based on single-server Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2010 deployments. The detection tools do not detect the applicability of the update on systems configured as part of a multiple-system SharePoint server farms. Note  If you have used an Administrative Installation Point (AIP) for deploying Office XP or Office 2003, you may not be able to deploy the update using SMS if you have updated the AIP from the original baseline. For more information, see the  Office Administrative Installation Point  heading in this section. Office Administrative Installation Point If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the  Update Compatibility Evaluator  components included with  Application Compatibility Toolkit . The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.
