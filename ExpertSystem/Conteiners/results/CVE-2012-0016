The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a legitimate file (such as an .xpr or .DESIGN file) that is located in the same network directory as a specially crafted dynamic link library (DLL) file. Then, while opening the legitimate file, Microsoft Expression Design could attempt to load the DLL file and execute any code it contained. For an attack to be successful, a user must visit an untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share and open a legitimate file (such as an .xpr or .DESIGN file) from this location that is then loaded by a vulnerable application. This security update is rated Important for all supported releases of Microsoft Expression Design. For more information, see the subsection,  Affected and Non-Affected Software , in this section. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which Microsoft Expression Design loads external libraries. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section,  Vulnerability Information . Recommendation.  The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see  Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871 . For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the  Microsoft Update  service. See also the section,  Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance , later in this bulletin.

Remote Code Execution Important Expression Design Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0016 A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Expression Design handles the loading of DLL files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see  CVE-2012-0016 . Mitigating Factors for Expression Design Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0016 Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation: Workarounds for Expression Design Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0016 Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality: FAQ for Expression Design Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0016 What is the scope of the vulnerability?   
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. What causes the vulnerability?   
The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft Expression Design incorrectly restricts the path used for loading external libraries. What is a Microsoft Expression Design Graphic (. xpr ) file?   
The Microsoft Expression Design Graphic (.xpr) file is a type of file created by Microsoft Expression Graphic Design (EGD), the predecessor to Microsoft Expression Design (ED); it stores a graphic that can be used as a user interface mockup. This file type was replaced by the .DESIGN file type in Expression Design. What is  a Microsoft Expression Design Drawing (.DESIGN) file ?   
The Microsoft Expression Design Drawing (.DESIGN) file is a type of file created by Microsoft Expression Design; it can contain both vector and raster graphics and can also include multiple layers and various image effects. What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?   
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If a user is logged-on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. How could an attacker exploit the  vulnerability?   
An attacker could convince a user to open a legitimate Expression Design-related file (such as an .xpr or .DESIGN file) that is located in the same network directory as a specially crafted dynamic link library (DLL) file. Then, while opening the legitimate file, Expression Design could attempt to load the DLL file and execute any code it contained. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a legitimate Expression Design-related file (such as an .xpr or .DESIGN file) to a user, and convincing the user to place the attachment into a directory containing a specially crafted DLL file and to open the legitimate file. Then, while opening the legitimate file, Expression Design could attempt to load the DLL file and execute any code it contained. In a network attack scenario, an attacker could place a legitimate Expression Design-related file and a specially crafted DLL in a network share, a UNC, or WebDAV location and then convince the user to open the file. What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?   
Systems where Microsoft Expression Design is used, including workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this. What does the update do?   
The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting the manner in which Microsoft Expression Design loads external libraries. When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?   
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?   
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued. Update Information Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance Security Central Manage the software and security updates you need to deploy to the servers, desktop, and mobile systems in your organization.
