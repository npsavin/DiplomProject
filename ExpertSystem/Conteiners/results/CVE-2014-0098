Diff to  previous 1575394  ( colored )  CVE-2014-0098 (reported by Rainer Canavan <rainer-apache 7val com>) Segfaults w/ truncated cookie logging. Clean up the cookie logging parser to recognize only the cookie=value pairs, not valueless cookies. This refactors multiple passes over the same string buffer into a single pass parser.

Diff to  previous 951895  ( colored )  Adding sub second timestamps and request end time to mod_log_config. Add special format tokens to %{...}t. The extended syntax allows the form: "WHICH:WHAT". WHICH is either: - "begin": use the time when the request started - "end": take "now" as the time You can omit WHICH, default is "begin". If you omit WHICH, the separating column is not allowed. WHAT is either: - "sec": timestamp in Unix seconds - "msec": timestamp in Unix milliseconds - "msec_frac": millisecond fraction of the Unix timestamp, 3 digits, 0-padded - "usec": timestamp in Unix microseconds - "usec_frac": microsecond fraction of the Unix timestamp 6 digits, 0-padded - anything different from those tokens: use strftime() You can omit WHAT, default is the formatted timestamp as used by the Common Log Format. The implementation uses a new request_config for mod_log_config to pass the request end time around between different calls to log formatters, but the end time is only generated if needed.

Other notes to test this patch: - You need to delete the util_uri.h file - exports picks up on this. - I'd like to remove the apr_uri.h from httpd.h, but that might increase the complexity of this patch even further. Once this patch is accepted (in some form), then I can focus on removing apr_uri.h from httpd.h entirely. I need baby steps (heh) right now. - I imagine that this might break a bunch of stuff in Win32 or other OS builds with foreign dependency files. Any help here is appreciated.

Diff to  previous 88888  ( colored )  Fix seg fault at start-up introduced by Ryan's change to enabl modules to specify their own logging tags. mod_log_config registers an optional function, ap_register_log_handler(). ap_register_log_handler() was being called by http_core before the directive hash table was created. This patch creates the directive hash table before ap_register_log_handler() is registered as an optional function.

Diff to  previous 88881  ( colored )  Allow modules to specify their own logging format specifier. Basically, mod_log_config has registered an optional function, that other modules can use to specify a function to be called. This is analogous to the way that mod_include works. This also allows http to do the connection logging itself, without exposing HTTP specific pieces to other modules.   Revision  88881  - ( view ) ( download ) ( annotate ) -  [select for diffs]

Diff to  previous 85045  ( colored )   This patch corrects the issues from the AP_EXPORT and linkage specification arguments to the ap_hooks.h declarations. As with the APR_ and AP_ patches, API_VAR_EXPORT becomes API_EXPORT_VAR, and MODULE_VAR_EXPORT becomes MODULE_EXPORT_VAR. I will be happy to revert the inclusion of ap_config.h from httpd.h if this bothers anyone. More individual modules need to be patched if we do so. The API_EXPORTs all moved into central storage in the ap_config.h header. Without WIN32 or API_STATIC compile time declarations, these macros remain no-ops. This patch also moves the following data from http_main to http_config: const char *ap_server_argv0; const char *ap_server_root; ap_array_header_t *ap_server_pre_read_config; ap_array_header_t *ap_server_post_read_config; ap_array_header_t *ap_server_config_defines; And the following variables had already moved into ap_hooks.c: ap_pool_t *g_pHookPool; (initialized now in http_config) int g_bDebugHooks; (out of http_config) const char *g_szCurrentHookName; (out of http_config) The changes to http_main.c are in preparation for that module to move out to a seperate .exe for win32. Other platforms will be unaffected, outside of these changes.   Revision  85045  - ( view ) ( download ) ( annotate ) -  [select for diffs]
