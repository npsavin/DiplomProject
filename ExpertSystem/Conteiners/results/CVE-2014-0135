Foreman Security process We take security issues seriously and welcome responsible disclosure from researchers discovering vulnerabilities in Foreman. Please email  foreman-security@googlegroups.com  (a private address for the security team) with all reports. We will endeavour to resolve high severity issues in the current stable release and lower severity issues in the next major release. Announcements of security issues will be made on  foreman-announce  when a release containing a fix is available to end users and credit will be given to the researcher if desired. Security advisories All security advisories made for Foreman are listed below with their corresponding  CVE identifier . Disclosure details CVE-2014-0208: stored cross site scripting (XSS) in search auto-completion The search auto-completion was vulnerable to a stored cross site scripting (XSS) attack via completion of (global/host) parameters in search keys. CVE-2014-0192: provisioning template previews are world-readable Provisioning templates previews ("spoof") are accessible without authentication when used with the hostname parameter. CVE-2014-0135: Kafo leaves world-readable default_values.yaml file When Kafo (used in the Foreman installer) runs, a /tmp/default_values.yaml file is written to and created with world readable permissions. This is prone to race-condition attacks and contains default values for all parameters, such as autogenerated passwords. CVE-2014-0090: session fixation, new session IDs are not generated on login Upon successful login, a new session ID was not generated for the user, so an attacker who had set the session ID in the request from the user's browser would be able to exploit the escalated session with the user's privileges. Thanks to Jeremy Choi and Keqin Hong of the Red Hat HSS Pen-Test Team for discovering this issue. CVE-2014-0089: stored cross site scripting (XSS) on 500 error page The 500 error page was vulnerable to stored cross site scripting attacks, where the error message was rendered without HTML encoding. In addition, bookmarks could be saved by any user with HTML in the name which caused an error when rendering the bookmark list, leading to a 500 error and execution of the HTML in the browser. Thanks to Jeremy Choi and Keqin Hong of the Red Hat HSS Pen-Test Team for discovering this issue. CVE-2013-4386: SQL injection in host/host group parameter overrides Host and host group parameter overrides (lookup_values) allowed SQL injection from the host FQDN or host group label. CVE-2013-4182: hosts API privilege escalation The /api/hosts API was found to provide access to all hosts without checking whether the current user has privileges to view a particular host. Thanks to Daniel Lobato Garcia of CERN IT-PES-PS for discovering this issue. CVE-2013-4180: DoS via hosts controller input conversion Power and IPMI boot actions converted user input to symbols, which could lead to memory exhaustion. Thanks to Marek Hulan of the Red Hat Foreman Team for discovering this issue. CVE-2013-2121: bookmarks remote code execution Bookmarks could be created in Foreman containing data that was later executed arbitrarily when reading the bookmark. Thanks to Ramon de C Valle of the Red Hat Product Security Team for discovering this issue. CVE-2013-2113: admin user creation, privilege escalation Non-admin user with permissions to create or edit other users were able to change the admin flag, or assign roles that they themselves do not have, enabling a privilege escalation. Thanks to Ramon de C Valle of the Red Hat Product Security Team for discovering this issue. CVE-2013-0210: Arbitrary command execution risk in smart proxy Requests to the smart proxy Puppet run API were not properly escaped when running the Puppet command, leading to possible arbitrary command execution. CVE-2013-0187: XMLHttpRequest bypasses authorization XMLHttpRequest or AJAX requests to Foreman were not subject to authorization checks, enabling privilege escalation for authenticated users. CVE-2013-0174: exposed hashed root passwords can be retrieved by unauthenticated remote users The external node classifier (ENC) API in Foreman was accessible to any remote host and the output would contain the hashed root psasword (used for unattended installation). Authentication and authorization features were added to the ENC API to secure this data. Thanks to Andreas Rogge for discovering this issue. CVE-2013-0173: insecure fixed salt "foreman" for passwords The salt used to hash root passwords (used for unattended installation) was fixed to the string "foreman" instead of being randomized. CVE-2013-0171: import allows unauthenticated YAML uploads/parsing leading to arbitrary code execution Fact and report import APIs in Foreman were accessible to any remote host and accepted YAML input, allowing arbitrary objects to be created on the Foreman server via YAML. Authentication and authorization features were added to the import APIs to prevent this. CVE-2012-5648: SQL injection through search mechanism Input to the search mechanism in Foreman was not escaped when constructing queries, enabling SQL injection into the resulting query. CVE-2012-5477: world writable files in smart proxy The smart proxy daemon ran with a umask of 0, causing files and directories written by it to have world-writable bits set. Files managed by the smart proxy could be modified by local users on the same host. This web site is licensed under a  Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License .
