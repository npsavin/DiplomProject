Subject:   [nginx-announce] nginx security advisory (CVE-2014-0088) 

 Hello! A bug in the experimental SPDY implementation in nginx 1.5.10 was found, which might allow an attacker to corrupt worker process memory by using a specially crafted request, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution (CVE-2014-0088). The problem only affects nginx 1.5.10 on 32-bit platforms, compiled with the ngx_http_spdy_module module (which is not compiled by default), if the "spdy" option of the "listen" directive is used in a configuration file. The problem is fixed in nginx 1.5.11. Patch for the problem can be found here: http://nginx.org/download/patch.2014.spdy.txt Thanks to Lucas Molas, researcher at Programa STIC, Fundación Dr. Manuel Sadosky, Buenos Aires, Argentina. -- Maxim Dounin http://nginx.org/en/donation.html
