Details An update for the seam-remoting component of Red Hat JBoss Web Framework 
Kit 2.5.0 that fixes one security issue is now available from the Red Hat 
Customer Portal. 

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate 
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, 
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in 
the References section. 
Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit combines popular open source web frameworks 
into a single solution for Java applications. The JBoss Seam Remoting 
component provides a convenient method for remotely accessing Seam 
components from a web page, using AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML). 

It was found that JBoss Seam response envelopes included unsanitized 
parameter and ID names provided in the request. This allowed a request to 
inject arbitrary XML into the response. A remote attacker could use this 
flaw to perform reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, provided the 
JBoss Seam remoting application did not use any cross-site request forgery 
(CSRF) protection. (CVE-2014-0149) 

All users of Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.5.0 as provided from the Red 
Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update. 

Solution The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must 
log in to download the update). Before applying this update, back up your 
existing installation of Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit. 

The JBoss server process must be restarted for this update to take effect.
