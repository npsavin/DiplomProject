symptom : "For the given implementation using an elliptic curve E over a binary field with a point G \in E, our attack recovers the majority of the bits of a scalar k when kG is computed using the OpenSSL implementation of the Montgomery ladder ; Our attack recovers the scalar k and thus the secret key of the signer and would therefore allow unlimited forgeries",
