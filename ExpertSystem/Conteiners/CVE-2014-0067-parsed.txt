{result:[{name : "CVE-2014-0067",
symptom : "While a test suite is running, a user with interactive access to the system can hijack the operating system user account running the suite ;  On Unix-like platforms the attacker needs to be able to reach the server\'s socket file, so the risk depends on where the platform places the socket file and whether there are filesystem permissions protections in place ;  The security impact was mostly that a role member could revoke access from others, contrary to the wishes of the role member\'s grantor ; Moreover, in many languages the validator might perform some limited amount of code execution, opening the possibility of an attacker executing code without permission ; This allows effects such as creating an index on a table one doesn\'t own, thus exposing data to the calling user that should not be able to access ; Inputs that were too long would be rejected needlessly, while outputs that were too long would result in stack corruption, which could crash the server and could be exploitable for arbitrary code execution ;   Buffer overflow in path_in()   Description  Predict integer overflow to avoid buffer overruns ; In passing, add check_stack_depth() to prevent stack overflow in related functions ;   Potential null pointer dereference crash when crypt(3) returns NULL  CVE-2014-0066  PostgreSQL: Potential null pointer dereference crash when crypt(3) returns NULL   Explanation  The chkpass extension uses the standard crypt() library function, which is defined to return NULL on failure, but it was not checking for NULL before using the result",
threat : " The security impact was mostly that a role member could revoke access from others, contrary to the wishes of the role member\'s grantor ; The security impact is thus that an authenticated database user might be able to escalate his or her privileges",
consequences : " On Unix-like platforms the attacker needs to be able to reach the server\'s socket file, so the risk depends on where the platform places the socket file and whether there are filesystem permissions protections in place ; Moreover, in many languages the validator might perform some limited amount of code execution, opening the possibility of an attacker executing code without permission ; This vulnerability exists in all affected versions, but is more easily exploited in 9.2 and 9.3 ;   Buffer overflow in path_in()   Description  Predict integer overflow to avoid buffer overruns ; In passing, add check_stack_depth() to prevent stack overflow in related functions",
